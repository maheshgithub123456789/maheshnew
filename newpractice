this is for the practice purpose only i want to push it to git repo
{\displaystyle C=\{\,a\mapsto 0,b\mapsto 01,c\mapsto 011\,\}}
is a code, whose source alphabet is the set 
{
𝑎
,
𝑏
,
𝑐
}
{\displaystyle \{a,b,c\}} and whose target alphabet is the set 
{
0
,
1
}
{\displaystyle \{0,1\}}. Using the extension of the code, the encoded string 0011001 can be grouped into codewords as 0 011 0 01, and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols acab.

Using terms from formal language theory, the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target alphabets, respectively. A code 
𝐶
:
𝑆
→
𝑇
∗{\displaystyle C:\,S\to T^{*}} is a total function mapping each symbol from S to a sequence of symbols over T. The extension 
𝐶
′
{\displaystyle C'} of 
𝐶
{\displaystyle C}, is a homomorphism of 
𝑆
∗{\displaystyle S^{*}} into 
𝑇
∗{\displaystyle T^{*}}, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols.
